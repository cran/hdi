\usage{
stability(x, y, EV, threshold = 0.75, B = 100, fraction = 0.5,
          model.selector = lasso.firstq, args.model.selector = NULL,
          parallel = FALSE, ncores = 4, trace = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{Design matrix (without intercept).}
  \item{y}{Response vector.}
  \item{EV}{Bound for expected number of false positives.}
  \item{threshold}{Threshold for selection frequency. Must be in (0.5, 1).}
  \item{B}{Number of sub-sample iterations.}
  \item{fraction}{Fraction of data used at each of the B sub-samples.}
  \item{model.selector}{Function to perform model selection. Default is
    \code{\link{lasso.firstq}}. User supplied function must have at
    least three arguments: x (the design matrix), y (the response
    vector) and q (the maximal model size). Return value is the index
    vector of selected columns. See \code{\link{lasso.firstq}} for an
    example. Additional arguments can be passed through
    \code{args.model.selector}.}
  \item{args.model.selector}{Named list of further arguments for
    function \code{model.selector}.}
  \item{parallel}{Should parallelization be used? (logical)}
  \item{ncores}{Number of cores used for parallelization.}
  \item{trace}{Should information be printed out while computing (logical).}
}
\details{...}

\value{
  \item{selected}{Vector of selected predictors.}
  \item{freq}{Vector of selection frequencies.}
  \item{q}{Size of fitted models in order to control error rate at
  desired level.}
